## Rules

- Build on the L1 Mainnet or Testnet
- All projects must submit transactions to the L1

## Judging

4 criteria are equaly weighted
- idea (the originality of the idea)
- implementation (the quality of the code and soundness of the architecture)
- demo (how well you articulate your solution for the user)
- potential (the total value transacted on chain, the business model, and the potential reach)
